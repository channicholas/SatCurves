# SatCurves

This is a project I made because I wanted to learn more about saturation curves in marketing. 
This project will fit C-shaped and S-shaped curves for a linear regression. It transforms the data provides a better fit than just a normal linear regression.
The benefit of using this is:
  1. To understand how marketing campaigns saturate at different levels 
  2. Have the ability to fit more types of curves than the normal transformations such as log transformations.
  3. Have a tool to build future Media Mix Models

Please see Demo.R for some demos on the types of curves and a better example with a salary dataset from Kaggle.
